# 3D-SARS-CoV-19-Protein-Visualization-With-Biopython

In this project you will create an interactive three-dimensional (3D) representation of SARS-CoV-19 (Coronavirus) protein structures & publication-quality pictures of the same, understand properties of SARS-CoV-19 genome, handle biological sequence data stored in FASTA & PDB (Protein Data Bank) and XML format, and get insights from this data using Biopython. This hands-on project will also give you a glimpse of tasks a Bioinformatician performs on a daily basis, along with the up-to-date concepts and database use cases in the field of Medical Research and Human genetics. In this project, we will also cover basics about important databases used by biologists and biotechnologists, along with the type of sequence data we can access and visualize from these databases using Biopython & Jupyter notebook.

## Learning Objectives
* Biological sequence and data manipulation with Biopython
* Create an interactive 3D model of SARS-CoV-19 Protein
* Query Biological Databases using Biopython & web-scraping

# Project-based Course Overview
## Welcome!
Welcome to 3D SARS-CoV-19 protein visualization with Biopython. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

## Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

Biological sequence and data manipulation with Biopython

Query Biological Databases using Biopython & web-scraping

Create an interactive  3D model of SARS-CoV-19 Protein

By the end of this course, you will be able to create an interactive three-dimensional (3D) representation of SARS-CoV-19 (Coronavirus) protein structures & publication-quality pictures of the same, understand properties of SARS-CoV-19  genome, handle biological sequence data stored in FASTA & PDB (Protein Data Bank) and XML format, and get insights from this data using Biopython.   

This hands-on project will also give you a glimpse of tasks a Bioinformatician performs on a daily basis, along with the up-to-date concepts and database use cases in the field of Medical Research and Human genetics. In this project, we will also cover basics about important databases used by biologists and biotechnologists, along with the type of sequence data we can access and visualize from these databases using Biopython & Jupyter notebook.

## Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.

3D SARS-CoV-19 protein visualization with Biopython: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure
The hands on project on 3D SARS-CoV-19 protein visualization with Biopython is divided into following tasks:

## Task 1: Introduction to Biopython
Brief introduction to Biopython, its applications and listing the modules/attributes which are built into Biopython.    

## Task 2: Understand FASTA file format
Reading and parsing biological sequences stored in FASTA format, describe, and calculate length and molecular weight of the sequence.    

## Task 3: Sequence manipulation using Biopython
Applying basic python indexing techniques to fetch a specific section of the biological sequence, compute GC content and search for codons and complement sequences using Biopython modules.

## Task 4: Transcription & Translation studies
Brief introduction to transcription and translation process, learn to transcribe and translate the sequence data, visualize amino acid content, and store sequences in Pandas Data frame.

## Task 5: Perform Basic Local Alignment using NCBI-BLAST
Performing BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) on translated amino acid sequence using BLAST tool from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) Database and list the parameters to identify the best aligned sequence.

## Task 6: Reading PDB file
Retrieving PDB files from Protein Data Bank database using PDB ID from previous task, read and parse PDB files and fetch features of protein sequence.

## Task 7: Visualizing SARS-CoV-19 Protein structures
Creating an interactive (publication-quality) visualization of protein, modify the structure to fit your preference and identify features of SARS-CoV-19 protein.

# Introductory Read
In the fields of Bioinformatics, Health and Medical Technology & Biotechnology, there is now a widespread need for visualization tools to present the 3D structure of proteins. There are only a few examples of protein function. A remarkable fact is that all tasks they can perform are based on a common principle, the twenty amino acids that can form a protein. That is the reason why studying proteins, their composition, structure, dynamics and function, is so important.

We must understand how these molecules fold, how they assemble into complexes, how they function if we wish to answer questions such as why we have cancer, why we grow old, why we get sick, how can we find cures for many diseases, why life as we know it has evolved in this way and on this planet and not anywhere else, at least for the moment. 
 
 All proteins functions are dependent on their structure, which, in turn, depends on physical and chemical parameters. This is another important fact on studying these molecules; classical biological, physical, chemical, mathematical and informatics sciences have been working together in a new area known as bioinformatics to allow a new level of knowledge about life organization. To understand structural biology, visualization of complex macromolecular structure (like proteins) is essential and macromolecular structure visualization is also now one of the primary steps in the process of drug design and discovery and docking studies. These studies are done virtually thus reducing animal trials and manpower.
